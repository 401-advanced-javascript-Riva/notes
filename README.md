# LAB 1- CLASS 1
## PROJECT: notes

*Author: Riva Davidowski**

**A terminal based (CLI) application allowing users to easily create and manage a list of categorized notes**

1. As a user, I want to be able to call the application using command line standard syntax, indicating the text of a note I wish to add so that the system will eventually be able to save this note.
2. As a user, I expect that the application will confirm my intent.
